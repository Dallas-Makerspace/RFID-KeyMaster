Write GPIO driver for use in DIN rail design without PiFace DigitalIO (almost done, need thorough test.)

Convert to syslog logging

Write new authentication driver for use with the (much simpler) DMS Common API (https://github.com/Dallas-Makerspace/CommonApi)

     Feature development

Allow operation without RGBLight as option (so I/O doesn't need to be allocated. (may be as simple as not loading module - needs checked)

Second scan effect (toggle, ignore if on, extend timer if on)
Invalid scan effect (output off, no effect)

programmable timeout (now fixed)

handle multiple contactors (just start separate parallel processes?) (immediate challenge here is multiple card readers. Linux or Python -not sure which doesn't seem to like multiple readers.  I can get devices delineated in /dev, but they no longer seem to read.)

analog current sense to support detection of machine state: on/machine running/overload
